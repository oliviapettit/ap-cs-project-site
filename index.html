    <h2>Haunted Mansion Game in Scratch</h2>

    <p>While completing the AP CS summer homework I created this game! The goal was to create a game using all we had learned over the summer in Scratch that met the given criteria. I learned a lot about the basics of block coding through creating this project and it was just overall pretty fun.</p>
